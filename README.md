# myMagicBall 🎱

**Do you need help to take a decision ? Use the Magic Ball!!!**

First, please don't take this to seriously. This ball won't be the answer to your reel problem. It's just for fun! 😉

This project is just to help me learn SwiftUI a little bit better.

It's an image of magic ball who display a random message when you click on the button "Shake Me".

- I will try to animate the ball, to give the impression that it shake.(When I'll be stronger, I'll try to use the shaking of the device)📳.
- I will try to use some transition on the message of the ball .
